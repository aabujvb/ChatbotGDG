            What is Codeforces?

I noticed long ago, that all the websites about computer     programming contests work on Web 1.0 principles. But the 21st     century has come, the 30th International Programming Contest took     place, and Google celebrated its 10th anniversary. Something has to     be done! As Software-as-a-Service is conquering the world, contests     administrators are still copying tests into judge systems. Something     has to be done!
 
  
 
Codeforces' aim is to offer you a convenient platform to     organize, run and discuss programming contests. It will be a bit of     a social network website, more than a news portal and more than an     online judge. Being absolutely independent from me, you will be able     to organize and run a contest. You will decide on your own if to     make it open to the whole world or if it will be a contest for your     University only. And if you're not interested in this, you might     discuss the news in the contest world - read/write blogs, discuss     topics, and support your dearest and nearest.
 
 
 
Moreover, I plan to run regular contests according to new and     interesting rules. Closer to the end of February I will be able to     run the first beta-contests.
 
 
 
But it's about the future, and now I suggest to go to Harbin     together with the Saratov State University team. I will be writing a     blog about our trip. I hope it will be interesting.
 
 
 
For sure, you will find out, that many important features are     missing there. It's because we're still working on it. Be patient,     please. I will be glad to read your comments about what and how     should be done. I can't promise that I'll be working on the system     during the trip, but I'll go on working when we come back.

When (approximately) do you expect codeforces to stop being beta?

Damm, so this is where it all began ! it feels like an ancient monument, I am leaving my mark here, and If in future I achieve something great, I will come back here to pay tribute to the website which helped me to achieve it.
Thank You!

Been 15 years from posting this, Codeforces is one of the biggest and best OJ now. Hope Codeforces can be better and better!
I really enjoy taking part in Codeforces contests (especially the contests fit me) although I can't always get up when there is a contest (because of sleep time).
(Not important: It's surprising that I am the first one to upvote this blog? Also I'm sorry for my comment, I think Codeforces is really good now so I can't stop myself from posting this.)

A. Theatre Squaretime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutTheatre Square in the capital city of Berland has a rectangular shape with the size n × m meters. On the occasion of the city's anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size a × a.What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square, but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides of the Square.InputThe input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,  m and a (1 ≤  n, m, a ≤ 109).OutputWrite the needed number of flagstones.ExamplesInputCopy6 6 4OutputCopy4
